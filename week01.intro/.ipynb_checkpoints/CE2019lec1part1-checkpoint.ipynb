    "This course will teach the basics of _programming and computational skills_ for economic analysis and enable the students to take _numerical approach to familiar mathematical problems_. Students will learn to graphically represent familiar ideas such as supply and demand curves, equilibrium prices and consumer choice. They will explore how these choices and equilibria change with shifts in policy instruments, preferences and technologies. In the process they will learn to use common computational solution methods, such as root finding and optimization. Students will also learn how to obtain, manipulate and represent data, using tools such as scatterplots and histograms.\n"
